# udemy_downloader_2020
this repo contains my project in which i have built udemy course downloader from udemy.com.  It downloads the videos only from paid courses.

This is project is made in node.js where it downloads entire course (course must be bought) in the local directory in an organized way by saving each videos inside folder named by module with every video numbered from 1. So it keeps the order as well.

Disclaimer: It only saves the content (videos) from the udemy courses that are bought at udemy site. It doesn't avail or offer the course for free.
